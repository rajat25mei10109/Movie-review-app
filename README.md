#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The CineCritique project is a full-stack movie review web application designed to provide users with a centralized, easy-to-use platform for discovering movies, submitting genuine reviews, and receiving personalized recommendations. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it delivers a responsive, intuitive user interface alongside secure backend services.
Key features include:
	•	User registration and authentication with secure password hashing.
	•	Comprehensive movie database with detailed metadata.
	•	Review and rating system allowing users to submit and view feedback.
	•	Real-time calculation and display of average movie ratings.
	•	Personalized recommendations based on users’ highest-rated genres.
	•	Search and filtering options for efficient movie discovery.
	•	Modular design and RESTful API architecture enabling scalability and maintainability.
The project addresses common challenges in movie discovery, such as fragmented reviews, lack of personalized suggestions, and difficulty accessing authentic user opinions. It emphasizes user engagement through community-driven content while maintaining data security and performance efficiency.
Implementation utilized React components and routing for frontend interactivity; Express.js and MongoDB for backend API and data management; and algorithmic techniques for rating aggregation and recommendation generation. The system was thoroughly tested for reliability, responsiveness, and usability, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
Overall, CineCritique stands as a robust platform combining entertainment discovery with social interaction, demonstrating practical software engineering skills and modern web development principles.
